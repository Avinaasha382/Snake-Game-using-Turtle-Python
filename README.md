# Snake-Game-using-Turtle-Python
 Hey everyone, I have written a code to recreate
 the snake game we used to play when we were young
 in our old Nokia Phones. I have been making this Project for a week from 24th Decemeber 2023. It was a good learning experience.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have used Turtle Graphics and used concepts of
 Object Oriented Programming(OOPS), like Inheritance,
 Slicing, Higher order functions and Event Handling using
 the Screen class of the turtle module
 <br> <br>

 You can also view your current score in the game on the 
top of the turtle screen.
